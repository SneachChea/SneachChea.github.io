# About me

</p>


After an engineering school ([Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), France) and a phD in fundamental physics at the universit√© de Sherbrooke under the supervision of
[Andre-Marie Tremblay](https://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/pages/tremblay), I am now looking for new opportunities outside the academic world.

During my graduate studies, I acquired a strong experience in high performance computing using C++ / python and applied it to solve problems in strongly correlated many-body physics. Once I finish to publish my last projects, I shall publish my programs on my github repos.
